Our project is about bringing sports easily accessible for casual people, by making a platform that makes booking shifts and finding events near
you easy. With buukkeri a service provider can log into the system and create events and shifts with location information, price and description
that can be viewed by users of the site. On users end events are suggested to them based on their location, events can also be browsed based on 
activity the user is interested in. By bringing people and service providers together in one platform, making notifications and announcements of
the activity can be done in a revolutionally way that has not been done before.
